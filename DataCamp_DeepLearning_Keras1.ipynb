    "It's time to get your hands dirty with optimization. You'll now try optimizing a model at a very low learning rate, a very high learning rate, and a \"just right\" learning rate. You'll want to look at the results after running this exercise, remembering that a low value for the loss function is good.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these exercises, we've pre-loaded the predictors and target values from your previous classification models (predicting who would survive on the Titanic). You'll want the optimization to start from scratch every time you change the learning rate, to give a fair comparison of how each learning rate did in your results. So we have created a function get_new_model() that creates an unoptimized model to optimize."

However in a multi-label problem each individual in the sample can have all, none or a subset of the available classes. As you can see in the image, multi-label vectors are also one-hot encoded, there's a 1 or a 0 representing the presence or absence of each class.\n",

    "Making a multi-label model for this problem is not very different to what you did when building your multi-class model. We first instantiate a sequential model. For the sake of this example, we will assume that to differentiate between these 3 classes, we need just one input and 2 hidden neurons. The biggest changes happen in the output layer and in its activation function. In the output layer, we use as many neurons as possible classes but we use sigmoid activation this time.\n",

    "\n",
    "We use sigmoid outputs because we no longer care about the sum of probabilities. We want each output neuron to be able to individually take a value between 0 and 1.

    "Binary cross-entropy is now used as the loss function when compiling the model. You can look at it as if you were performing several binary classification problems: for each output we are deciding whether or not its corresponding label is present. When training our model we can use the validation_split argument to print validation loss and accuracy as it trains. By using validation_split, a percentage of training data is left out for testing at each epoch.\n",

    "\n",
    "Using neural networks for multi-label classification can be performed by minor tweaks in our model architecture. If we were to use a classical machine learning approach to solve multi-label problems we would need more complex methods. One way to do so consists of training several classifiers to distinguish each particular class from the rest. This is called one versus rest classification.\n",

    "\n",
    "By now you've trained a lot of models. It's time to learn more about how to better control and supervise model training by using callbacks.\n",
    "2. What is a callback?\n",
    "\n",
    "A callback is a function that is executed after some other function, event, or task has finished. For instance, when you touch your phone screen, a block of code that identifies the type of gesture will be triggered. Since this block of code has been called after the touching event occurred, it's a callback.\n",
    "3. Callbacks in Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same way, a keras callback is a block of code that gets executed after each epoch during training or after the training is finished. They are useful to store metrics as the model trains and to make decisions as the training goes by.\n",
    "4. A callback you've been missing\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time you call the fit method on a keras model there's a callback object that gets returned after the model finishes training. This is the history object. Accessing the history attribute, which is a python dictionary,we can check the saved metrics of the model at each epoch during training as an array of numbers.\n",
    "5. A callback you've been missing\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the most out of the history object we should use the validation_data parameter in our fit method, passing X_test and y_test as a tuple. The validation_split parameter can be used instead, specifying a percentage of the training data that will be left out for testing purposes. That way we not only have the training metrics but also the validation metrics.\n",
    "6. History plots\n",
    "\n",
    "You can compare training and validation metrics with a few matplotlib commands. We just need to define a figure. Plot the values of the history attribute for the training accuracy (acc) and the validation accuracy (val_acc). We can then make our graph prettier by adding a title, axis labels and a legend.\n",
    "7. History plots\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see our model accuracy increases for both training and test sets till it reaches epoch 25. Then accuracy flattens for the test set whilst the training keeps improving. Overfitting it's taking place since we see the train keeps improving as test data decreases in accuracy. More on this in the next chapter.\n",
    "8. Early stopping\n",
    "\n",
    "Early stopping a model can solve the overfitting problem. Since it stops its training when it no longer improves. This is extremely useful since deep neural models can take a long time to train and we don't know beforehand how many epochs will be needed. Early stopping, like other keras callbacks can be imported from keras callbacks. We then need to instantiate it. The early stopping callback can monitor several metrics, like validation accuracy, validation loss, etc. These can be specified in the monitor parameter. It's also important to define a patience argument, that is the number of epochs to wait for the model to improve before stopping it's training. There's no rules to decide which patience number works best at all times,this depends on the implementation. It's good to avoid low values, that way your model has a chance to improve at a later epoch.The callback is passed as a list to the callbacks parameter in the model fit method.\n",
    "9. Model checkpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "The model checkpoint callback can also be imported from keras callbacks. This callback allows us to save our model as it trains. We specify the model filename with a name and the .hdf5 extension. You can also decide what to monitor to determine which model is best with the monitor parameter, by default validation loss is monitored. Setting the save_best_only parameter to True guarantees that the latest best model according to the quantity monitored will not be overwritten. \n",
    "\n",
    "# The history callback\n",
    "\n",
    "The history callback is returned by default every time you train a model with the .fit() method. To access these metrics you can access the history dictionary parameter inside the returned h_callback object with the corresponding keys.\n",

    "The irrigation machine model you built in the previous lesson is loaded for you to train, along with its features and labels now loaded as X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test. This time you will store the model's historycallback and use the validation_data parameter as it trains.\n",

    "It’s time to learn the concepts of batch size and batch normalization.\n",
    "2. Batches\n",
    "\n",
    "A mini-batch is a subset of data samples. If we were training a neural network with images, each image in our training set would be a sample and we could take mini-batches of different sizes from the training set batch.\n",
    "3. Mini-batch\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that during an epoch we feed our network, calculate the errors and update the network weights. It's not very practical to update our network weights only once per epoch after looking at the error produced by all training samples. In practice, we take a mini-batch of training samples. That way, if our training set has 9 images and we choose a batch_size of 3, we will perform 3 weight updates per epoch, one per mini-batch.\n",
    "4. Mini-batches\n",
    "\n",
    "Networks tend to train faster with mini-batches since weights are updated often. Sometimes datasets are so huge that they would struggle to fit in RAM memory if we didn't use mini-batches. Also, the noise produced by a small batch-size can help escape local minima. A couple of disadvantages are the need for more iterations and finding a good batch size.\n",
    "5. Effects of batch sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you can see how different batch sizes converge towards a minimum as training goes by. Training with all samples is shown in blue. Mini-batching is shown in green. Stochastic gradient descent, in red, uses a batch_size of 1. We can see how the path towards the best value for our weights is noisier the smaller the batch_size. They reach the same value after a different number of iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1 Stack Exchange\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Batch size in Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "You can set your own batch_size with the batch_size parameter on the model's fit method. Keras uses a default batch-size of 32. Increasing powers of two tend to be used. As a rule of thumb, you tend to make your batch size bigger the bigger your dataset.\n",
    "7. Normalization in machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization is a common pre-processing step in machine learning algorithms, especially when features have different scales. One way to normalize data is to subtract its mean value and divide by the standard deviation.We always tend to normalize our model inputs. This avoids problems with activation functions and gradients.\n",
    "8. Normalization in machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This leaves everything centered around 0 with a standard deviation of 1.\n",
    "9. Reasons for batch normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalizing neural networks inputs improve our model. But deeper layers are trained based on previous layer outputs and since weights get updated via gradient descent, consecutive layers no longer benefit from normalization and they need to adapt to previous layers' weight changes, finding more trouble to learn their own weights. Batch normalization makes sure that, independently of the changes, the inputs to the next layers are normalized. It does this in a smart way, with trainable parameters that also learn how much of this normalization is kept scaling or shifting it.\n",
    "10. Batch normalization advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "This improves gradient flow, allows for higher learning rates, reduces weight initializations dependence, adds regularization to our network and limits internal covariate shift; which is a funny name for a layer's dependence on the previous layer outputs when learning its weights. Batch normalization is widely used today in many deep learning models.\n",
    "11. Batch normalization in Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch normalization in Keras is applied as a layer. So we can place it in between two layers. We import batch normalization from Keras layers. We then instantiate a sequential model, add an input layer, and then add a batch normalization layer. We finalize this binary classification model with an output layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Changing batch sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "You've seen models are usually trained in batches of a fixed size. The smaller a batch size, the more weight updates per epoch, but at a cost of a more unstable gradient descent. Specially if the batch size is too small and it's not representative of the entire training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how different batch sizes affect the accuracy of a simple binary classification model that separates red from blue dots.\n",

    "If we import the Keras backend we can build a function that takes in an input tensor from a given layer and returns an output tensor from another or the same layer. Tensorflow is the backend Keras is using in this course, but it could be any other, like Theano. To define the function with our backend K we need to give it a list of inputs and outputs, even if we just want 1 input and 1 output. Then we can use it on a tensor with the same shape as the input layer given during its definition. If the weights of the layers between our input and outputs change the function output for the same input will change as well. We can use this to see the output of certain layers as weights change during training, we will check this in the exercises!\n",

    "\n",
    "This makes autoencoders useful for things like: Dimensionality reduction, since we can obtain a smaller dimensional space representation of our inputs. De-noising, if trained with clear data and then fed with noisy data they will be able to decode back a good representation of the input data without noise. Anomaly detection, if you train an autoencoder to map inputs to outputs with data but you then pass in strange values, the network will fail at giving accurate output values. Many other applications can also benefit from this architecture.\n",
    "9. Building a simple autoencoder\n",
    "\n",
    "To make an autoencoder that maps a hundred inputs to a hundred outputs, encoding the inputs into a layer of 4 neurons, we would do the following: Instantiate a sequential model, add a dense layer of 4 neurons with an input_shape of a hundred and end with an output layer of 100 neurons. We use activation sigmoid because we assume that our output can take a value between 0 and 1, we end compiling our model with adam optimizer and binary_crossentropy loss since we used sigmoid.\n",
    "10. Breaking it into an encoder\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've built and trained your autoencoder you might want to encode your inputs. To do this, you just have to build a new model and add the first layer of your previously trained autoencoder. This new model predictions returns the 4 numbers given by the 4 neurons of the hidden layer for each observation in the input dataset. \n",

You'll see that this model is powerful enough to learn text relationships, we aren't using a lot of text in this tiny example and our sequences are quite short. This model is to be trained as usual, you would just need to compile it with an optimizer like adam and use crossentropy loss. This is because we have modeled this next word prediction task as a classification problem with all the unique words in our vocabulary as candidate classes."
